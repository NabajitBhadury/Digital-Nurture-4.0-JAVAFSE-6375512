 Understand Recursive Algorithms
What is recursion?
Recursion is when a method calls itself to solve a smaller part of the problem.

It simplifies problems that can be broken into similar subproblems.

Example:
To compute factorial(n), we can define:

matlab
Copy
Edit
factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)
until factorial(0) = 1 (the base case).

Why is recursion useful?
Breaks complex problems into smaller subproblems
Leads to simpler and cleaner code
Matches mathematical definitions naturally (e.g., growth models)
