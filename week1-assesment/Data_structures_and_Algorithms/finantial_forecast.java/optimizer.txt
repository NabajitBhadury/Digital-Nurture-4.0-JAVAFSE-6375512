 Time Complexity
Each recursive call reduces periodsLeft by 1:
Time complexity: O(n)
where n = periodsLeft.

This is because the recursion runs once for each period.

How to optimize?
For this simple case:

Recursion is fine, as it is linear in depth.

But recursion adds function call overhead â€” iterative or direct formula is better.
